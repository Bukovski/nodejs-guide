# nodejs-guide

A simple project to practice working with nodejs.

The project use `mongodb` databases.
Saves user data in server-side `session` to mongodb database.
`Hides menu` items for `unauthorized users`. 
We store all user `data in sessions`.
`Encrypts the password` before saving to the database. Uses `tokens` to protect data submission `forms`.`Displays error messages` to the user on the page.
It is possible to `change the password` for a registered user.The login form has a `button` to `change the password`. A `link` to `change the password` will be `sent to the email` by which the user is registered.
All input forms are `validated`
