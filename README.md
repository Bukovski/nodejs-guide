# NodeJs guide

This is project to practice working with nodejs.

The project use `mongodb` databases.
Saves user data in server-side `session` to mongodb database.
`Hides menu` items for `unauthorized users`. 
We store all user `data in sessions`.
`Encrypts the password` before saving to the database. Uses `tokens` to protect data submission `forms`.`Displays error messages` to the user on the page.
It is possible to `change the password` for a registered user.The login form has a `button` to `change the password`. A `link` to `change the password` will be `sent to the email` by which the user is registered.
All input forms are `validated`
`Uploading files` for products on the site and saving to `images` folder, as well as deleting them with the product. Create an Invoice `PDF file` from the shopping cart and saving to `data/invoices` folder.
`Pagination` for `products`. Shows no more than two products on one page, scatters the rest on pages
`Pay from cart` goes through the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment system.
All http requests will be saved to the `access.log` file.
All settings are saved to file `nodemon.json`

You can find a live example of a site on [heroku-exapmple](https://node-guide-dev.herokuapp.com/) if it still works of course.
